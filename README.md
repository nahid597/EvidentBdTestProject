# Ami Coding Pari nah

This is Basically test project that was given by evidentBd to test my skill. Basically is't sorting and searching algorithm based proejct. Here user can enter some number and also enter search number if number is availabe in input field then it's return true other return false. When i store input value in database it is sorted data. For searching i am using linear search and for sorting i am using bubble sort.


## Techlogies: 
    Node js
    Express js
    MongoDB
    React js
    CSS3
    Bootstrap4
    HTML5
    
## Implementation

 Build for client side i am using react js. React js is a very light weight javascript library to build the UI. TO build client side logic i am using react js.
 For backend side logic i am using exrpress js. Using express js i created some api that depends on authentication, post data and get data. For authentication i am using jwt. To sotre the data i am using mongodb. All data saved in locally. If any one want to store data in cloud just he/she can change change the url. Then it will be work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
