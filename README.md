This is Basically test project that was given by evidentBd to test my skill. Basically is't sorting and searching algorithm based proejct. Here user can enter some number and also enter search number if number is availabe in input values then it's return true otherwise return false. When i store input value in database it is sorted data. For searching i am using linear search and for sorting i am using bubble sort.

## Implementation

 Build for client side i am using react js. React js is a very light weight javascript library to build the UI. TO build client side logic i am using react js.
 For backend side logic i am using exrpress js. Using express js i created some api that depends on authentication, post data and get data. For authentication i am using jwt. To  sotre the data i am using mongodb. All data saved in locally. If any one want to store data in cloud just he/she can change change the url. Then it will be work.
